# Adding Words


You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by dashes (-).
The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.

## Sample Input
this
is
great

## Sample Output
this-is-great
Recall, using *args as a function parameter enables you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function.
