# Zoo


You manage a zoo. Each animal in the zoo comes from a different country. Here are the tables you have:

A new animal has come in, with the following details:
name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1
Add him to the Animals table.

2) You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zooâ€™s visitors. Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, sorted by countries.

Recall INSERT and INNER JOIN keywords.
