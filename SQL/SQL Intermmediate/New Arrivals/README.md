# New Arrivals 

You are working with the library books database.

The Books table has the columns id, name, year.

The library has new books whose information is stored in another table called "New", however they do not have a year column.

Write a query to select the books from both tables, Books and New, combining their data. For the year column of the New books use the value 2022.

Also, select only the books that are released after the year 1900. 

The result set should contain the name and year columns only, ordered by the name column alphabetically.
