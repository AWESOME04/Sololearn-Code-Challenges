# Email Generator 

You need to generate emails for the Employees.

The email format is firstname.lastname@company.com

So, for example, for John Smith the email would be: john.smith@company.com

Note, that the email should be in lowercase.

Write a query to create the email addresses for all employees in the table and output the result in a new column called "email".

Sort the result by the email column in ascending order.
