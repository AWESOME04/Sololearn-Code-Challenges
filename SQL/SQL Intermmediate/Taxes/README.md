# Taxes 

You are working on the Employees table, which stores the names and salaries of employees.

You need to calculate the taxes for the salaries and output them as a new column.

The tax percentage is based on the salary amount:

    0 - 1500:       10%
    1501 - 2000: 20%
    2001+:          30%

Output the firstname, lastname, salary and tax columns of the table, sorted by the lastname column in ascending order.


## Hint: To calculate the percentage of a number, simply multiply it by the percentage divided by 100. For example, to get 10%, multiply the number by 0.1.
