# Factorial

The factorial of a number N is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

For example, the factorial of 5 is 1* 2 * 3 * 4 * 5  = 120.

Create a program that takes a number from input and output the factorial of that number.

Use a for loop to make the calculation, and start the loop from the number 1.
