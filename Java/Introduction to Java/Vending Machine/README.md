# Vending Machine

You are making a program for a vending machine that provides drinks.

The menu of the drinks is stored in an array called menu:

String[] menu = {"Tea", "Espresso", "Americano", "Water", "Hot Chocolate"}; 
JAVA

Take the choice of the customer as an integer from input and output the corresponding menu item.

Also, check for errors: in case the input is out of the range of the array, output "Invalid".

The choice defines the index of the array.
