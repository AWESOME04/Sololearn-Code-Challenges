# Boxes

You are making a robot that should categorize items by their color.

Each color corresponds to a box with a specific number.

For simplicity, our program will handle 3 colors:

red goes to box #1

green goes to box #2

black goes to box #3

Your program needs to take a color as input and output the corresponding box number.

## Sample Input

green

## Sample Output

2

Remember, you can use the switch statement to check for different conditions.
