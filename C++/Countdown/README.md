# Countdown


You need to make a countdown app.
Given a number N as input, output numbers from N to 1 on separate lines.
Also, when the current countdown number is a multiple of 5, the app should output "Beep".

## Sample Input:
12

## Sample Output:
12
11
10
Beep
9
8
7
6
5
Beep
4
3
2
1
Hint: You can use the modulo operator % to check if a number is a multiple of 5.
